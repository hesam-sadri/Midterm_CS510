# Midterm_CS510
This Repository is crated to save the midterm project of CS510
In this project we will use stuck market Data and try to predict the future stuck prices, I wonder how many times we would predict successfully.
I will use different time series models and a sliding window, based on the data in the range of window I will predict tommorow's market direction. Later I will evaluate the correctness of my prediction by comparing it with the real value of the stuck.
So I will go to back in time (for example 5 years) and will use a sliding window (for example 100 days data) and based on this data I will predict the next day market direction, later I will evaluate the performance of my prediction and then move the window further and do another prediction and so on.

Here is the list of the modification made for the final:

I tried to address all the comments on peer reviews:

- Adding more comments to the variables and adding some explanation to the functions.
- I made changes in readme.txt. And changed the written format from the first person to a general form.
- reorganizing the project and adding source and test folders.
- Adding a test file that tests if the program works correctly on some sample stock symbol.
- using <- for all of the assignments.
- using space preceding the left parenthesis.
- Adding variables to the predict_fn function to make the if statement more readable and marginally more 
efficient as suggested.
- Rewrite the code in Get_Sym and modifying the while(TRUE), as you suggested. 
- Adding more comments to explain the result and outputs.
- Adding a report in r markdown, with a new idea that improves the success rate of predictions.
